# Function-Block-Logic-Generator
 This project is to automate the railway signaling logic design on PLC IDE. <br />
 This project is so simple but has a big impact where we usually design the logic manually for 1 - 3 months. with this logic generator, we can cut that up to 3 days of working.

to use this software we need the PLC project file which I don't attach in terms of company property. 
this software takes input from the interlocking tables, and then it produces the sets of CSV files that can later be imported to the PLC project IDE.
